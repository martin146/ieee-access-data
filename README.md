# Accuracy Assessment and Cross-Validation of LPWAN Propagation Models in Urban Scenarios

The archive contains results from two measurement campaigns conducted in two midsize cities Brno and Ostrava, in the Czech Republic. The measurements were performed for three major LPWA technologies NB-IoT, Sigfox, LoRaWAN.

## Path Loss Functions

For better accessibility, the archive also contains Matlab function giving mean path loss values for five fine-tuned propagation models. Each model can be used as a stand-alone function. The example usage for each model is provided in _main.m_ file.
